Undoubtedly we are all aware of the rapid spread of COVID-19. This infectious disease poses serious threats to the public health and economies of nations. The number of cases around the world have been growing exponentially. We see that nowadays people with mild symptoms who don’t even have covid are mistaken by the fact that they might have caught the virus. Hence, they go to the hospital for a test thereby wasting kits which are already very less in number as compared to India’s population. Therefore due to shortage of kits it would be helpful if the doubtful cases could ﬁnd the results using just their X- rays. Machine learning methods can be applied  to search for a model to distinguish cases of COVID-19 based on chest X-rays (CXR). Hence i will try to provide an application that will be helpful for hospitals to save time and maintain a recorded data of the patients suﬀering from covid-19 and the patients that are the carriers so that doctors can distinguish between them with their chest X-rays. This would save time ,as well as ensure the safety and health of people. 
### My web application will address the following issues :
 - Lack of kits worldwide
 - Will help to Increase the availability of hospital beds
 - Prevention of wastage of kits
 - Quicker and faster results

I will be working on an open image dataset of Lung x-ray's of people that have tested positive for COVID-19. Using these I will try to build a deep convolutional neural network which allows for both binary and multi-class classification. Although the Image Dataset for positive cases is relatively small for now, but results might be quite useful as image classifiers don't require big datasets. I will be experimenting in applying machine learning methods to search for a model to distinguish cases of COVID-19 based on chest X-rays (CXR).  
 
## To summarize the idea: 
 
• Collecting the images from the open data set for COVID-19 chest Xrays. • Exploration of a machine learning model to distinguish chest X-rays of patients who have tested positive for COVID-19.
